# Apophenia
Trying to find patterns in beer league chaos.

## Project Goals
1. (First Stage) A robust data mining engine for advanced analysis of game statistics
   * Player pairs (Frequent goal-assist combinations)
   * Referee Tendencies (common calls per ref, PM per game per ref, best/worst referee combinations)
   * Goalie nemesis
2. (Second Stage) A companion app for D League Radio broadcasters highlighting relevant information
   * When a player is entered in the system, automatically show relevant data (point milestones, when last goal was scored, etc.)
   * SportsEngine integration for automatic updates
   * Lots of input from broadcasters on helpful features

## Preliminary Task List
   * Get Season - Find the seasons list page for all seasons; differentiate between pre and post CIDL
   * Get Teams - For a season, find all the teams and different divisions
   * Get Schedule - For each season, get a list of all games
   * Get Game Data - Scrape data from game sheets?

   * Players moving up/down divisions
   * Goalie records vs. individual teams
   * Team shots per period
   * Goalie save percentage per period
   * Spider chart for players and goalies on key stats

   * Goalie nemesis

   * Pre/Post CIDL Team History (need to work out how to handle this)
      * Rookies
