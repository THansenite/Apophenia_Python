# Apophenia
Trying to find patterns in beer league chaos.

## Project Goals
1. (First Stage) A robust data mining engine for advanced analysis of game statistics
   * Player pairs (Frequent goal-assist combinations)
   * Referee Tendencies (common calls per ref, PM per game per ref, best/worst referee combinations)
   * Goalie nemesis
2. (Second Stage) A companion app for D League Radio broadcasters highlighting relevant information
   * When a player is entered in the system, automatically show relevant data (point milestones, when last goal was scored, etc.)
   * SportsEngine integration for automatic updates
   * Lots of input from broadcasters on helpful features
